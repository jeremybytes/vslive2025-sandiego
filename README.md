## Sessions  

**T07 Introduction to XAML - Don't Fear the Markup**  
*Level: Introductory*  

Understanding XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language) is key to creating great user experiences in .NET MAUI, WPF, WinUI, and Uno Platform. We will cover the basics around XAML including a look at namespaces, elements, properties, events, attached properties, and layout. We'll create a simple WPF application that covers the fundamentals, and you will leave with a better understanding of how to create more complex layouts. Even if you primarily use a visual editor (such as in Visual Studio), knowing the markup gives you the extra boost to make the final tweaks and ensure and excellent experience for your users.  

You will learn:

* Create UI elements with XAML markup.  
* Use attached properties to customize your UI.  
* Explore how XAML relates to C# objects and code.

* Slides: [/T07-intro-to-xaml/SLIDES-IntroToXAML.pdf](./T07-intro-to-xaml/SLIDES-IntroToXAML.pdf)
* Sample Code: [/T07-intro-to-xaml/SampleCode/](./T07-intro-to-xaml/SampleCode/)

**T12 Catching Up with C# Interfaces: What You Know May Be Wrong**  
*Level: Intermediate*  

Over the last several years, C# interfaces went through some major changes, but many where not well publicized or explored -- including default implementation, member access modifiers, and static members. The Microsoft documentation is correct, but many other C# resources have outdated information. So let's look at these changes and see where they are useful and where they should be avoided. The world of interfaces has changed; the line between interfaces and abstract classes has blurred; and C# now has multiple inheritance (sort of). With some practical tips, "gotchas", and plenty of examples, we'll see how to use these features effectively (and safely) in our code.

You will learn:

* Pros and cons of default implementation in interfaces  
* Why you may want a "private" interface member  
* Why you need to be more explicit when using interfaces
